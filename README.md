# Subtraction_techniques

In this repository you will find MATLAB codes that compute a modified representation of layer potentials to avoid the close evaluation problem.
Codes have been used to produce numerical results in the manuscript entitled "Layer potential identities and subtraction techniques", Carvalho (2020).

* There are two folders: 2D for two dimensional problems, 3D for three dimensional problems
* In 2D:
* * Run SingleLayerPotential_subtraction.m to compute the modified representation of the solution of the exterior Neumann Laplace's problem
* * Run Helmholtz_subtraction_techniques.m to compute the modified representation of the solution of the sound-soft scattering problem
* * BoundaryCurve.m allows you to change the boundary 
* In 3D:
* * Run SLP3Dbasic_density_subtraction.m to compute the modified representation of the solution of the exterior Neumann Laplace's problem
* * Run helmholtz3D.m to compute the modified representation of the solution of the sound-soft scattering problem
* * ComputeSurface.m allows you to change the boundary
